# Simple Maps and Locations with Bitcoin Payments

21.11.2024

The first Slovenian Bitcoin conference is behind us. It got us a little hyped. The price also played its part. ;)
It became clear that it would be great for Bitcoin enthusiasts to know where in Maribor we can pay with Bitcoin.

After a quick research, we found that there is a website, [btcmap.org](btcmap.org), and that there are two types of POS terminals that allow Bitcoin Lightning payments.

We will demonstrate how to find locations that **accept BTC**. Alongside this, we will showcase free maps from **OpenStreetMap** and wrap it up with presentations of two POS terminals currently in use in Slovenia, especially in Maribor.
