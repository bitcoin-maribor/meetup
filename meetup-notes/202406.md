# Genealogy of Blockchain Technology

27.6.2024

At the **10th meetup of the Bitcoin Maribor** group, we will focus on blockchain technology. **Klemen** will provide an overview of its origins and development over time and demonstrate how the meaning of this concept has been corrupted today. Since the inception of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has been embroiled in media frenzy and has turned into a buzzword used to label any new technological project that needs venture capital from angel investors. For this reason, we will attempt to distinguish its original meaning from today's broader use, to better find the needle in the haystack.
