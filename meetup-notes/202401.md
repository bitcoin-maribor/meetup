# How to get the first bitcoin and how to store it

25.1.2024

Since the first purchase of bitcoin and its subsequent storage can be a very stressful experience for most beginners, we have decided to start from the very beginning this time. At the next meetup Danilo will present how to easily buy the first satoshis (fractions of bitcoin) and how to safely store them. We will go through what needs to be done during the first purchase, how to buy it and where to buy it. Of course, after the purchase, it is necessary to securely store the funds, and that will be also the topic of this month meetup.
