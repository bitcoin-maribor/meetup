20.12.2023

The brand-new-not-yet-available Trezor Safe 3, is going to be a star of the evening, compared to the very fresh Keystone 3 PRO. Is there anything simpler than BitBox02 and smaller than JADE?
**Elvis** hopes to address your questions, doubts, and fears regarding the use of hardware wallets. Perhaps he even creates new ones.
